# Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to extract those features whose variance explains most of the variance in the given dataset. These features (principal components) are what our machine learning models are trained on and can simplify the runtime of such algorithms.

In this folder, we perform principal component analysis on the [penguins dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title") to understand which of the real-valued features explain most of the variation in the dataset.
