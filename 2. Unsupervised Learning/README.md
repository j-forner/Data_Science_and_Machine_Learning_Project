# Unupervised Learning

## Introduction
**Unsupervised learning** is another main machine learning paradigm, and it's defined by its use of unlabeled training data, i.e. data whose labels are *not* known. Like supervised machine learning, we can use unsupervised machine learning algorithms to solve both classification and regression problems, and will do so with the algorithms/techniques listed below. As a final note, there are two main realms that unsupervised machine learning algorithms fall into: clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## Algorithms/Techniques Implemented in this Folder
