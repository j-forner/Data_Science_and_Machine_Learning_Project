# Data Science and Machine Learning Project

This repository is a journey through the various machine learning algorithms presented in my Spring 2022 Data Science and Machine Learning course at Rice University (INDE 577). We divide this journey into two main parts, namely, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. An explanation of each of these broad classes has been provided in their respective folders. Within each of these two main folders, there are subfolders corresponding to a particular algorithm; each contains an explanation along with an implementation on a given dataset.

Thank you for looking, and if you have any questions, feel free to email me at:
