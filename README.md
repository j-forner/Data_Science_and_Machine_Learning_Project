# Data Science and Machine Learning Project

This repository is a journey through the various machine learning algorithms presented in my Spring 2022 Data Science and Machine Learning course at Rice University, INDE 577. We divide this journey into two main parts -- namely, supervised and unsupervised machine learning -- and in both cases explain, implement, and conduct error analsyes on various algorithms of each type.
