# Data Science and Machine Learning Project

This repository is a journey through the various machine learning algorithms presented in my Spring 2022 Data Science and Machine Learning course at Rice University (INDE 577). We divide this journey into two main parts -- namely, supervised and unsupervised machine learning. 

To provide background on these two main classes of algorithms, detailed explanations have been given in their respective folders. Within each of these two main folders, there are subfolders, each corresponding to a particular algorithm.

Thank you for exploring this repository. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out at:
