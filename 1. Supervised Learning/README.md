# Supervised Learning

## Introduction
**Supervised learning** is one of the main machine learning paradigms, and is defined by its use of labeled training data, i.e. data whose labels/classes are known. We can use supervised machine learning algorithms for both classification and regression problems, and will do so with the algorithms listed below.
