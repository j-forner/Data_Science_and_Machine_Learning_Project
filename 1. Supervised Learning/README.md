# Supervised Learning

## Introduction
**Supervised learning** is one of the main machine learning paradigms, and is defined by its use of labeled training data, i.e. data whose features and labels are both known. We can use supervised machine learning algorithms to solve both classification and regression problems, and will do so with the algorithms listed below.
