# Linear Regression

In constrast to classification tasks -- in which we predict categorical labels -- regression tasks involve predicting real-valued target labels. A common type of regression model is **linear regression**, where we assume that there is a linear relationship between the target values and the feature vectors.

In this folder, we use the single neuron linear regression model to find an underlying relationship between temperature and frequency of cricket chirps. The data is provided by the [Cricket Chirp vs Temperature Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hershyandrew/cricket-chirp-vs-temperature/ "Title").
