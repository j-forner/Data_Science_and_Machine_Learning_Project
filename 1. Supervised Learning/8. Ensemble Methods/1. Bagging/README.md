# Bagging

Bagging, short for **b**ootsrap **agg**regating, is an ensemble learning method used to reduce variation in a noisy dataset [https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/bagging].

In this folder, we employ bagging to predict whether a penguin is of the Gentoo or Chinstrap species. We again use the data from the [penguins dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title").
