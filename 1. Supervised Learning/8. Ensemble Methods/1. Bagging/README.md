# Bagging

Bagging, short for **b**ootsrap **agg**regating, is an ensemble learning method used to reduce variation in a noisy dataset. It starts by choosing a random sample of data in a training set, and after repeating this several times (with replacement), the weak models obtained in this process are trained independently. We take from them the average or majority of those predictions to obtain a more accurate estimate, based on whether we have a regression or classification task, respectively.

In this folder, we employ bagging to predict whether a penguin is a Gentoo or Chinstrap penguin. We focus specfically on the bill length and bill depth measurements from the [penguins dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title").
