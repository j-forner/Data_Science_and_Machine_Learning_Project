# Random forests

Random forests is an ensemble learning method that aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees to solve classification or regression tasks [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest].

In this folder, we employ a random forest to predict whether a penguin is of the Gentoo or Chinstrap species, similar to the task we solved using bagging. We again use the [penguins dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title").
