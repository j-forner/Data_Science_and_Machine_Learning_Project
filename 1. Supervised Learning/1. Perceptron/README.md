# Introduction

The perceptron is a function approximation algorithm designed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.[^fn]. It uses a linear combination of the feature values of given data to linearly separate it into two classes. We can therefore say that the perceptron algorithm is a **linear classifier** and a **binary classifier**, respectively. 

In this folder, we implement the perceptron from scratch and use it to classify penguin species. The data is provided by the palmer penguins dataset.
