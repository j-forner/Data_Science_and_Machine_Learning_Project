# Introduction

The perceptron algorithm was designed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.[^fn] It is a function approximation model that seeks to linearly separate two classes of data (i.e. a **binary classifier**), and takes as inputs a linear combination of the features of given data (i.e. a **binary classifier**). In this folder, we implement the perceptron algorithm and run it on the Palmer Penguins dataset.
