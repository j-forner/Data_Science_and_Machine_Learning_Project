# Introduction

The perceptron algorithm is a function approximation model designed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.[^fn]. It takes as an input a linear combination of the features of given data, and with this it seeks to linearly separate said data into two classes. We therefore say that the perceptron algorithm is a **linear classifier** and a **binary classifier**, respectively. In this folder, we implement the perceptron algorithm and run it on the Palmer Penguins dataset.
