# Introduction

The perceptron algorithm is a a function approximation model designed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.[^fn] It seeks to linearly separate two classes of data, and takes as inputs a linear combination of the features of given data. We therefore say that the perceptron algorithm is a **linear classifier** and a **binary classifier**, respectively. In this folder, we implement the perceptron algorithm and run it on the Palmer Penguins dataset.
