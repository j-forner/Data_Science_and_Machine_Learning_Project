# Decision Trees

Decision trees are a supervised learning method that learns binary decision rules based on data features. These decision rules effectively split the feature space into smaller subregions, which we can use to determine which class a data point is in.

In this folder, we use the [UCI banknote authentication dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication "Title") to determine whether certain banknotes are authentic (0) or counterfeit (1).
