# AdaBoost

Boosting is an ensemble method that trains predictors sequentially in a manner that corrects the mistakes of previous predictors. AdaBoost, short for **ada**ptive **boost**ing, is a particular boosting method that assigns relative weights to misclassified training instances. The next predictor in the sequence is then trained on the data using the relative weights generated by the previous predictor's estimates, and this process continues iteratively.

In this folder, we use AdaBoost on the [penguins dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title") to classify between Gentoo or Chinstrap species of penguins, and again use bill length and bill depth measurements.
