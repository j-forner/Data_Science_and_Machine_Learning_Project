# Single Neuron Logistic Regression

We conclude our study of single neuron models with the single neuron logistic regression model. This model is a binary classifier, and in our case we use the sigmoid activation function and the binary cross entropy loss function to assign probabilities of being in one of two classes.

More specifically, we use the single neuron linear regression model to predict whether a penguin is of the Gentoo or Chinstrap species. Again we use the data from the [penguins dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title").
