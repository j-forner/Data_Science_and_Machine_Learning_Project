# Single Neuron Logistic Regression

We conclude our study of single neuron models with the single neuron logistic regression model. This model is a binary classifier, and in our case we use the sigmoid activation function and the binary cross entropy loss function to assign probabilities for data points being in one of two classes.

More specifically, we use the single neuron logistic regression model to predict whether a penguin's species is Gentoo or Chinstrap. We use the data from the [penguins dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title"), and focus on bill lenth and bill depth measurements.
