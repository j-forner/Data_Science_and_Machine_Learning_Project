Regression trees are a supervised learning method similar to decision trees (described in section 6), except now the predicted outcome is real-valued.

In this folder, we use the [abalone dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset "Title") to predict the age of abalone based on its length.
