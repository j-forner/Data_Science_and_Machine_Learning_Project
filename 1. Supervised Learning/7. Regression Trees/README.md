# Regression Trees

Regression trees are a supervised learning method similar to decision trees (described in section 6), except now the target values is real numbers.

In this folder, we use the [abalone dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset "Title") to predict the age of abalone based on its length. In the dataset, the given attributes for each abalone are as follows: sex, length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and rings (which are used to calculate age).
