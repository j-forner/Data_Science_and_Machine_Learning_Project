# Regression Trees

Regression trees are a supervised learning method similar to decision trees (described in section 6), except now the predicted outcome is real-valued.

In this folder, we again use the [abalone dataset](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv "Title") to predict the age of abalone based on its length and diameter.
