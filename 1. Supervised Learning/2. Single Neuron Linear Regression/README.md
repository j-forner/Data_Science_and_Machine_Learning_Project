# Single Neuron Linear Regression

In constrast to classification tasks -- in which we predict categorical labels -- regression tasks involve predicting real-valued target values. A common type of regression model is **linear regression**, where we assume that there is a linear relationship between the target values and the feature vectors.

In this folder, we use the single neuron linear regression model (which uses a linear activation function and the mean squared error loss function) to find an underlying relationship between cricket chirps per second and temperature. The data is provided by the [Cricket Chirp vs Temperature dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hershyandrew/cricket-chirp-vs-temperature/ "Title"), which contains 100 simulated measurements of (temperature, chirps per seconds) pairs.
